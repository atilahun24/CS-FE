Beep is a car review app written by you for you. All reviews are from actual
customers not paid reviewers. Users can create a review for any car in the world
and check out reviews that other users have made as well.

back end repo: https://github.com/atilahun24/CS-BE

technologies used: JavaScript, React, Bootstrap

unsolved problems: mostly styling issues

planning, process, problem-solving: I initially was going to create a car
shopping app using a third party api, however, the link to the API Console for
the api I was going to use was broken and there were no decent alternatives so I
decided to change it to a car review site and seed the app myself.

user stories:
as a user, I would like to search for a car by make, model and year
as a user, I would also like to see additional information about the vehicle displayed
as a developer, I would like the app to be reliable and bug-free
as a user, I would like to see a clean layout
